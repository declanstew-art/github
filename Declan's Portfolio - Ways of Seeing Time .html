      <p>Ways of Seeing Time is an investigation into the methods we use to visualise the concept of time. The publication displays research into how time is not just used for its functional purposes, but as an element used in relation to things like; leisure and tourism, records and achievements, nostalgia, communication, branding and fashion. The investigation aims to look past some of the literal and functional uses of time into some of the more abstract, playful and metaphorical notions of time as well.</p><br/>
