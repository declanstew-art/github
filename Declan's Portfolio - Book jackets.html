      <p>This school of art project saw the redesign of two iconic penguin book jackets. Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit’s new jacket boasts a sophisticated colour palate, delicate typography and a design that reflects its contemporary, enquiring and literary readership. Freakanomics jacket was visualised through bold colours and playful typography - bringing the many themes and layers within, to life.</p><br/>
